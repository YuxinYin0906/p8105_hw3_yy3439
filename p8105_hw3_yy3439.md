### Problem 3

``` r
#Load Data

nhanes_covar <- read_csv("nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4)
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
nhanes_accel <- read_csv("nhanes_accel.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
#Organize the `covar` Dataset
covar_clean = nhanes_covar|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    sex = 
      case_match(
        sex,
        1 ~ "male",
        2 ~ "female"),
    sex = as.factor(sex)
      )|> #recode the numerical sex variable to factor variables;this code was borrowed from lecture notes"Tidy Data"
  mutate(
    education = 
      case_match(
        education,
        1 ~ "Less than high school",
        2 ~ "High school equivalent",
        3 ~ "More than high school"),
    education = as.factor(education)
      )|>
  filter(age >= 21)|> #filter out only participants aged 21 or 21+
  drop_na() #drop NA values
```

``` r
#Organize the `accel` Dataset

accel_clean = nhanes_accel|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  drop_na()
```

``` r
# Joinging Data set
joined_dataset <- left_join(covar_clean, accel_clean, by = "seqn") 
```

The final merged data set contains all variables from the `covar` and
`accel` datasets and joined by the variable `seqn`, which appears in
both datasets.

#### Table 1: Number of Male and Female in each of the Education Category

``` r
edu_gender <- joined_dataset|>
  group_by(sex, education)|>
  drop_na()|>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop")|>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = count
  )|>
  knitr::kable(caption = "Number of Male and Female in Each Education Level")
```

As shown in the table, the total number of female participants who have
less than and more than high school degrees is larger than the total
number of male participants. In contrast, the total number of male
participants who have high school degrees is larger than the female
participants.

#### Visualization of the Age Distribution for Male and Female Participants

``` r
joined_clean_data <- joined_dataset|>drop_na()
ggplot(joined_clean_data, 
       aes(x = education, y = age, color = sex)) +
       geom_boxplot()+
       labs(
         title = "Age Distribution for Education Level of Male and Female Participants",
         x = "Education Level",
         y = "Age"
       )+
  theme_minimal()
```

shown in the boxplot, the medians of age distribution in which females
who have high school or less than high school degrees are larger than
the male participants. Specifically, people who aged below 50s tend to
have higher than high school degrees, and the age distribution in which
male and female participants having less than high school degrees are
similar.

#### Total Activity Time per Participant

``` r
activity_par <- joined_clean_data|>
  group_by(seqn)|>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "activity"
  )|>
  summarise(total_activity_time = sum(activity))
```

#### Visualization of the Total Activity Time per Participant

``` r
total_activity = inner_join(joined_clean_data, activity_par, by = "seqn")|>
  relocate(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education,total_activity_time ) #binding the two dataset and relocate so we can see the total activity time more easily 
```

``` r
#Visualization
ggplot(total_activity, aes(x = age, y = total_activity_time, fill = sex))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(
    title = "Total Activity Time for Each Participant",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total Activity Time"
  )+
  facet_grid(.~education)

\##### Discussion As shown in the plot above, male with high school
equivalaent and more than high school degrees generally have more
activity time compared to their female counterparts. However, female
with less than high school degrees have more activity time on average
compared to their male counterparts across the age group. For all male
and female, people who are younger than 40 years old have the most
activity time whereas the activity time dropped eminently for people
aged 60 or above.
